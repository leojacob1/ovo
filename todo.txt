* only calculate the highsAndLows the first time
* make a fully functioning weighting control panel

    * auto updating table?
* get 2017 stats!
* don't rerender all the time (because of axios call)
* why is matt joyce the best at bbRate?
* get in control of when table adjusts (right now it's doing it
without dispatching because of Object.assign state change i think)
